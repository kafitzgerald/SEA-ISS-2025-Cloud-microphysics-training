**Abstract**: This notebook presents two atmospheric sciences demonstration applications in the [Fiats](https://go.lbl.gov/fiats) deep learning software repository. The first, `train-cloud-microphysics`, trains a neural-network cloud microphysics surrogate model that has been integrated into the [Berkeley Lab fork](https://go.lbl.gov/icar) of the Intermediate Complexity Atmospheric Research (ICAR) model. The second, `infer-aerosol`, performs parallel inference with an aerosol dynamics surrogate pretrained in PyTorch using data from the Energy Exascale Earth System Model ([E3SM](https://e3sm.org)). This notebook presents the program statements involved in using Fiats for aerosol inference and microphysics training. In order to also give the interested reader direct experience with using Fiats for these purposes, the notebook details how to run two simpler example programs that serve as representative proxies for the demonstration applications.  Both proxies are also example programs in the Fiats repository. The microphysics training proxy is a self-contained example requiring no input files.  The aerosol inference proxy uses a pretrained aerosol model stored in the Fiats JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file format and hyperlinked into this notebook for downloading, importing, and using to perform batch inference calculations with Fiats.
